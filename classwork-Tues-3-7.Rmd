## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(paleobioDB)
library(paleotree)
data(graptPBDB)
head(graptOccPBDB)
     
occSpecies <- taxonSortPBDBocc(graptOccPBDB, rank = "species")
head(occSpecies)
#plotting species occurances
plotOccData(occSpecies, groupLabel = "species")
#convert occurance data to timelist format
graptTimeSpecies <- occData2timeList(occList=occSpecies)
#plot diversity through time
taxicDivDisc(graptTimeSpecies)
head(graptTimeSpecies)

occGenera <-taxonSortPBDBocc(graptOccPBDB, rank = "genus")
occFamily <- taxonSortPBDBocc(graptOccPBDB, rank = "family")

pdf(file="dtt.pdf")
taxicDivDisc(graptTimeSpecies)
taxicDivDisc(graptTimeGenus)
taxicDivDisc(graptTimeFamily)
dev.off()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
libray(paleobioDB)
lirary()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
